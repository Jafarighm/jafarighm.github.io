<div style="text-align: justify">The purpose of this training was, first of all, to get familiar with spatial information systems, to know coordinate systems, image systems and their differences, and secondly, to learn the basics of QGIS software.
After introducing the software, we prepared the map in QGIS, then reviewed the preliminary styling of the vector layers, and at the end, we examined the processing of spatial and descriptive information.</div>
