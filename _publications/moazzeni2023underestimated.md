Abstract:
---------------
<div style="text-align: justify">Although the mountains in South-West Asia are a global biodiversity hotspot, our understanding of their biodiversity, especially in the commonly remote alpine and subnival zones, is still limited. This is well exemplified here by <em>Aethionema umbellatum</em> (Brassicaceae), a species considered to have a wide yet disjoint distribution in the Zagros and Yazd-Kerman mountains of western and central Iran. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic data (based on plastid <em>trn</em>L-<em>trn</em>F and nuclear ITS sequences) show that <em>A. umbellatum</em> is restricted to a single mountain range in southwestern Iran (Dena Mts., southern Zagros), whereas populations from central Iran (Yazd-Kerman and central Zagros) and from western Iran (central Zagros) belong to species new to science, <em>A. alpinum</em> and <em>A. zagricum</em>, respectively. Both new species are phylogenetically and morphologically close to <em>A. umbellatum</em>, with which they share unilocular fruits and one-seeded locules. However, they are easily distinguishable by leaf shape, petal size, and fruit characters. This study confirms that the alpine flora of the Irano-Anatolian region is still poorly known. As the proportion of rare and local endemic species in alpine habitats is high, these habitats are of prime interest for conservation efforts.</div>
