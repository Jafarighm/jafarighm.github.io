<div style="text-align: justify">I am a dedicated biologist with a profound passion for unravelling the mysteries of life. My expertise lies in the realms of phylogeny and ecological niche modelling, where I meticulously explore how species evolve and intricate patterns of biodiversity. My mission is twofold: to push the boundaries of scientific understanding by advancing the field, and to translate this knowledge into tangible solutions for pressing environmental challenges. I am deeply committed to bridging the gap between academia and the wider world, making the complexities of science accessible and relatable, especially for those outside the scholarly sphere. Beyond my scientific pursuits, I find immense joy in the creative strokes of painting and the structured logic of programming. These diverse passions fuel my curiosity and drive me to contribute meaningfully to both the scientific community and society at large. </div>
